# football-RPG
A game descripes both the sports career and personal life of 
a footballer.

## What's the project?
The project aims to develop a game in which player plays as a
footballer. The game would not only mention the footballers 
sports career, every match he has played, his training plan,
blablabla (as we have experienced too many times in FIFA and
PES), but also his personal life, his relationship to his 
teammates and coaches, his negotiations with senior 
management and sponsors, his sh*t words posting to rivals, 
and,well, his romantic story. The idea is inspired by the 
game *New Star Soccer*.

## Technical Note
We haven't decide which tool to build up the project yet. 
Anyway, we perfer using a free, open-source game engine to 
make to game.

## Progress of works
Now we are trying to build up a basic frame of the match 
engine.
